# Crypyo Watch
## _Watch Your Favorite Crypto Coins With Ease_

Crypto Watch is a website that showcases the market cap of cryptocurrencies along with their symbols, providing users with valuable insights into the world of digital assets.

## Features

- View real-time market cap data for currencies.
- Add currencies to your watchlist to keep track of your favorite cryptocurrencies.
- Remove currencies from your watchlist when you no longer wish to monitor them.
- Search for a currency to access real-time data.

## Tech

Crypto Watch uses the following to function:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Coingecko API

## Bugs

- The API has a request rate limit of only 30 requests per minute, which can lead to timeouts and slow response times.
- The search results return the market cap while the displayed currencies on load return the total market cap due to a difference in the API endpoints.

These limitations are a result of the free API package, which restricts available endpoints and enforces a low request rate limit. Upgrading to a more comprehensive package is the recommended solution to enhance Crypto Watch's functionality and user experience.
